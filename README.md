# PrintLang

PrintLang is a "programming language" written in Python 3 (the interpreter for it was written in Python 3) that has syntax heavily based on 
BASIC and other "flavors" of BASIC.

Any use of this interpreter outside of you just wanting to play around with PrintLang (highly doubt that lol) should include a credit to me, its original creator.

# Syntax

Lol there's really nothing to the syntax, it's exactly like BASIC:
```bas
PRINT "Hello, world!"
```
And that's about it, really.

# Use

Running a PrintLang program is *extremely* easy. All you have to do is:
  - Have Python 3 installed
  - Have a source file for PrintLang, of which the extension is `.pl`
  - Have the interpreter on your machine

That's really it. A PrintLang file can be run by entering the following command into a MacOS/Linux/UNIX terminal:
```
python3 main.py program.pl
```
On Windows
```
py main.py program.pl
```
See; really simple.

# The Future of PrintLang

I might add more to PrintLang in the future, but I am not entirely sure yet.
