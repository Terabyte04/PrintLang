# PrintLang

PrintLang is a "programming language" written in Python 3 (the interpreter for it was written in Python 3) that has syntax heavily based on 
BASIC and other "flavors" of BASIC.

Any use of this interpreter outside of you just wanting to play around with PrintLang (highly doubt that lol) should include a credit to me, its original creator.
